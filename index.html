		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>Hello, I am a full-time chiropractic student in Malaysia. In my spare time, I like to read, code, dabble a little in ultimate frisbee and in recent times, I enjoy some care-free doodling too.</p>

		<h3>Why am I doing this?</h3>
		<p>Amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, where majority around the world is stuck at home or isolated somewhere, I decided to look into <span><a href="https://skillshare.com" target="_blank">Skill Share</a></span>, in hopes of picking up a new skill. It was then that I stumbled upon 2 courses which inspired me to pick up coding and start doodling. What attracted me was not only how useful these skills can be but also the fact that it was super easy to start and truly anybody can pick up these skills. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The reason I chose doodling was because it would be able to capture my thoughts and my inner creative. So this would serve as some sort of journaling. I hope by the end of a 100 days I would have gained the skill to express my emotions through doodling and I also hope that I would've connected with you as you read through my doodles.
		<br>
		<br>
		This website is will be a testimony to my journey into coding and doodling and I hope it brings you as much joy as it did for me. Also, I hope to show that it doesn't take a genius to pick up a new skill and if I can do it, you can do it too!

			Day 1 of 100<br>
			Date: 15/05/2020<br>
			Description: Coming into this challenge I made sure to have fun and be loose, as is the point of this challenge. Initially, I had multiple brain farts when thinking of what to doodle. Then I asked myself a question: "What word would best describe how I've been feeling in recent days?". The word "Grow" came up repeatedly and I've associated growth with plants. Then, I put my hands into action. The reason I've chosen the letter R as the stem is because the commmon denominator between "gReen", "bRown" and "gRow" is R. Actually, I'm kidding, it's not as profound as it sounds. Hope you liked the artwork! :P

			Day 2 of 100<br>
			Date: 16/05/2020<br>
			Description: This was actually completed in less than 10 minutes. I just drew what I was doing, which was brainstorming. I associated the brain, some thunderbolts and lightbulbs to the word "brainstorming" and this is my product. I guess at the end of a 100 days, I would hope that my creativity would come out flowing easily with an abundance of ideas. Hope you liked it!
